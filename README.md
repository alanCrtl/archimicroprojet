## how kafka works (chatgpt)

Here's a basic overview of how Kafka works:

1. Topics: Data is organized into topics, which act as message categories. Producers send messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to topics to receive messages.

2. Producers: Producers are responsible for publishing messages to Kafka topics. They push messages to Kafka brokers.

3. Brokers: Kafka brokers are servers that store data and serve client requests. They manage the distribution of data across topics and partitions.

4. Partitions: Each topic is divided into partitions, and each partition is ordered. Partitions allow Kafka to parallelize processing and scale horizontally.

5. Consumers: Consumers subscribe to topics and process the messages produced by producers. Consumers are grouped, and each consumer group receives a copy of the messages in a topic.
